            Black Panther is a 2018 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. Produced
            by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the eighteenth film in the
            Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film is directed by Ryan Coogler, who co-wrote the screenplay with Joe
            Robert Cole, and stars Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa / Black Panther, alongside Michael B. Jordan, Lupita
            Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Winston Duke, Angela Bassett, Forest
            Whitaker, and Andy Serkis. In Black Panther, T'Challa is crowned king of Wakanda following his father's death,
            but his sovereignty is challenged by an adversary who plans to abandon the country's isolationist policies and
            begin a global revolution.
    
            Wesley Snipes expressed interest in working on a Black Panther film in 1992, but the project did not come to
            fruition. In September 2005, Marvel Studios announced a Black Panther film as one of ten based on Marvel
            characters and distributed by Paramount Pictures. Mark Bailey was hired to write a script in January 2011. Black
            Panther was announced in October 2014, and Boseman made his first appearance as the character in Captain
            America: Civil War (2016). By 2016, Cole and Coogler had joined; additional cast joined in May, making Black
            Panther the first Marvel film with a predominantly black cast. Principal photography took place from January to
            April 2017, at EUE/Screen Gems Studios in the Atlanta metropolitan area, and Busan, South Korea.
    
            Black Panther premiered in Los Angeles on January 29, 2018, and was released theatrically in the United States
            on February 16, in 2D, 3D, IMAX and other premium large formats. The film received praise from critics for its
            direction, screenplay, acting (particularly that of Boseman, Jordan, Gurira, and Wright), costume design,
            production values, and soundtrack, though the computer-generated effects received some criticism. Many critics
            considered it to be one of the best films set in the MCU and noted its cultural significance, with organizations
            including the National Board of Review and American Film Institute naming it one of the Top 10 Films of 2018.
            During its theatrical run, it became the 9th-highest-grossing film of all time with over $1.35 billion worldwide
            and the 3rd-highest-grossing film of all time in North America with over $700 million, breaking numerous box
            office records including the highest-grossing film by a black director, and becoming the highest-grossing 2018
            film in the U.S. and Canada and second-highest-grossing film of 2018 worldwide.
    
            The film received numerous awards and nominations, with seven nominations at the 91st Academy Awards including
            Best Picture, with wins for Best Costume Design, Best Original Score, and Best Production Design. Black Panther
            is the first superhero film ever to receive a Best Picture nomination, as well as the first film in the MCU to
            win an Academy Award. The film also received three nominations at the 76th Golden Globe Awards, two wins at the
            25th Screen Actors Guild Awards, and twelve nominations at the 24th Critics' Choice Awards (winning three),
            among others. A sequel is in development with Coogler returning to write and direct.

        Black Panther is a 2018 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. Produced
        by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the eighteenth film in the
        Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film is directed by Ryan Coogler, who co-wrote the screenplay with Joe
        Robert Cole, and stars Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa / Black Panther, alongside Michael B. Jordan, Lupita
        Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Winston Duke, Angela Bassett, Forest
        Whitaker, and Andy Serkis. In Black Panther, T'Challa is crowned king of Wakanda following his father's death,
        but his sovereignty is challenged by an adversary who plans to abandon the country's isolationist policies and
        begin a global revolution.

        Wesley Snipes expressed interest in working on a Black Panther film in 1992, but the project did not come to
        fruition. In September 2005, Marvel Studios announced a Black Panther film as one of ten based on Marvel
        characters and distributed by Paramount Pictures. Mark Bailey was hired to write a script in January 2011. Black
        Panther was announced in October 2014, and Boseman made his first appearance as the character in Captain
        America: Civil War (2016). By 2016, Cole and Coogler had joined; additional cast joined in May, making Black
        Panther the first Marvel film with a predominantly black cast. Principal photography took place from January to
        April 2017, at EUE/Screen Gems Studios in the Atlanta metropolitan area, and Busan, South Korea.

        Black Panther premiered in Los Angeles on January 29, 2018, and was released theatrically in the United States
        on February 16, in 2D, 3D, IMAX and other premium large formats. The film received praise from critics for its
        direction, screenplay, acting (particularly that of Boseman, Jordan, Gurira, and Wright), costume design,
        production values, and soundtrack, though the computer-generated effects received some criticism. Many critics
        considered it to be one of the best films set in the MCU and noted its cultural significance, with organizations
        including the National Board of Review and American Film Institute naming it one of the Top 10 Films of 2018.
